# FAKESTORE API PROJECT

The main goal for the project is to fetch fakeStore API and display data to the user interface. 

User has ability to see a list of products from api, delete products, add products, and update products. 

The navigation bar, buttons and other html tags were  styled using react-bootstrap documentations.

useParams() function were very essential in accessing product id for an individual item and were helpful in viewing details of the item, updating and deleting items from api.

useNavigate() and Routing methods played a big role in navigating from one components to another.
