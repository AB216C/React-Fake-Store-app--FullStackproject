# FAKESTORE API PROJECT

The main goal for the project is to fetch assigned fakeStore API and display data to the user interface. In addition, Users of this application have the ability to see a list of products from API, delete products, add new products, and update product information. Users can also add items to the cart and view all items added to the cart together with their prices.

The navigation bar, buttons, and other HTML tags were styled using react-bootstrap documentation and CSS.

useParams() function was essential in accessing product ID for individual items and helped in viewing details of the item, updating,  and deleting a specific item from API.

useNavigate() and Routing methods played a big role in navigating from one component page to another.
